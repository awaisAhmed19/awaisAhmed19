## Popular repositories
> *Loading... please wait... still loading... ok done.*

---

🌟 [**ScientificCalculator**](https://github.com/awaisAhmed19/ScientificCalculator)  
I'm using Python to write a scientific calculator **from scratch** without using too many inbuilt functions because... I hate myself 😊.  
Why use `math.sqrt()` when you can relive math class trauma, right?

---

🌟 [**RetroMSpaint**](https://github.com/awaisAhmed19/RetroMSpaint)  
Not the new shaggy MS Paint but the **Windows 98** version —  
Inspired by the legendary [jspaint.app](https://jspaint.app). I'm cloning it in my own messy but passionate way to learn about full-stack web app development (and maybe suffer a little).

---

🌟 [**DSA-journal**](https://github.com/awaisAhmed19/DSA-journal)  
Just me writing Data Structures & Algorithms in C because Leetcode wants me to cry.  
Low-level pain, high-level gain.

---

🌟 [**ScientificCalcWebapp**](https://github.com/awaisAhmed19/ScientificCalcWebapp)  
Took that masochistic Python calculator and decided, “You know what would be worse? Turning it into a webapp.”  
Using JavaScript because why not fry my brain twice.

---

🌟 [**Chess**](https://github.com/awaisAhmed19/Chess)  
C-coded chess. Yeah, I'm *that* guy. No graphics, just pure terminal-based strategy and suffering.

Feel free to explore my repositories for more chaos, code, and crying.  
⭐ Star them so GitHub thinks I'm cool (I promise I won't cry this time).
